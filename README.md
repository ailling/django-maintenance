Django middleware that allows you to perform maintenance on your application without having to restart your server. Other maintenance mode solutions for Django rely on a settings.py change, which in turn needs a server restart (touching the wsgi file, or even restarting Apache). This application allows you to control maintenance mode from the Django admin, customizing the message available to the end user, and for how long the application will be down. You can even schedule future maintenance windows without having to worry about manually taking down the application when maintenance becomes necessary.
